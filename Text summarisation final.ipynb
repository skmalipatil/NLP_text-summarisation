      "While Louis D. Brandeis’s series of articles on the money trust was\n",
      "running in Harper’s Weekly many inquiries came about publication in\n",
      "more accessible permanent form.. In various\n",
      "  ways, no doubt; but perhaps the most critical step was when he\n",
      "  calculated just how long it would take a fast worker to go through\n",
      "  the Glavis-Ballinger record and make a judgment of it; whereupon he\n",
      "  decided that Mr. Wickersham could not have made his report at the\n",
      "  time it was stated to have been made, and therefore it must have\n",
      "  been predated.. Nearly two\n",
      "  years before Mr. Mellen resigned from the New Haven Railroad, Mr.\n",
      "  Brandeis wrote to the present editor of this paper a private letter\n",
      "  in which he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "  “When the New Haven reduces its dividends and Mellen resigns, the\n",
      "  ‘Decline of New Haven and Fall of Mellen’ will make a dramatic\n",
      "  story of human interest with a moral--or two--including the evils\n",
      "  of private monopoly.. “‘Remember, O Stranger, Arithmetic is the first of the sciences and\n",
      "  the mother of safety.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "The exposure of the bad financial management of the New Haven railroad,\n",
      "more than any other one thing, led to the exposure and comprehension\n",
      "of the wasteful methods of big business all over the country and\n",
      "that exposure of the New Haven was the almost single-handed work of\n",
      "Mr. Brandeis.. Behind his understanding of the methods of\n",
      "obtaining insurance and the proper cost of it to the laboring man lay\n",
      "a philosophy of the vast advantage to the fibre and energy of the\n",
      "community that would come from devising methods by which the laboring\n",
      "classes could make themselves comfortable through their whole lives\n",
      "and thus perhaps making unnecessary elaborate systems of state help.. The welfare of the laborer and his relation\n",
      "to his employer seems to Mr. Brandeis, as it does to all the most\n",
      "competent thinkers today, to constitute the most important question we\n",
      "have to solve, and he won the case, coming up to the Supreme Court of\n",
      "the United States, from Oregon, establishing the constitutionality of\n",
      "special protective legislation for women.. In the Minimum Wage case,\n",
      "also from the State of Oregon, which is about to be heard before the\n",
      "Supreme Court, he takes up what is really a logical sequence of the\n",
      "limitation of women’s hours in certain industries, since it would be\n",
      "a futile performance to limit their hours and then allow their wages\n",
      "to be cut down in consequence.. He knows as much about the\n",
      "Interior Department today as I do.” In that controversy, the power of\n",
      "the administration and of the ruling forces in the House and Senate\n",
      "were combined to protect Secretary Ballinger and prevent the truth\n",
      "from coming to light.. Of\n",
      "the truths which are embodied in the essays printed in this book, some\n",
      "are being carried out now, but it will be many, many years before the\n",
      "whole idea can be made effective; and there will, therefore, be many,\n",
      "many years during which active citizens will be struggling for those\n",
      "principles which are here so clearly, so eloquently, so conclusively\n",

      "President Wilson, when Governor, declared in 1911:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The great monopoly in this country is the money monopoly.. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our\n",
      "activities are in the hands of a few men, who, even if their actions\n",
      "be honest and intended for the public interest, are necessarily\n",
      "concentrated upon the great undertakings in which their own money\n",
      "is involved and who, necessarily, by every reason of their own\n",
      "limitations, chill and check and destroy genuine economic freedom.. This\n",
      "is the greatest question of all; and to this, statesmen must address\n",
      "themselves with an earnest determination to serve the long future and\n",
      "the true liberties of men.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pujo Committee--appointed in 1912--found:\n",
      "\n",
      "  “Far more dangerous than all that has happened to us in the past in\n",
      "  the way of elimination of competition in industry is the control of\n",
      "  credit through the domination of these groups over our banks and\n",
      "  industries.”...\n",
      "\n",
      "  “Whether under a different currency system the resources in our\n",
      "  banks would be greater or less is comparatively immaterial if they\n",
      "  continue to be controlled by a small group.”...\n",
      "\n",
      "  “It is impossible that there should be competition with all the\n",
      "  facilities for raising money or selling large issues of bonds in\n",
      "  the hands of these few bankers and their partners and allies, who\n",
      "  together dominate the financial policies of most of the existing\n",
      "  systems..... The acts of this inner group, as here described, have\n",
      "  nevertheless been more destructive of competition than anything\n",
      "  accomplished by the trusts, for they strike at the very vitals\n",
      "  of potential competition in every industry that is under their\n",
      "  protection, a condition which if permitted to continue, will\n",
      "  render impossible all attempts to restore normal competitive\n",
      "  conditions in the industrial world....\n",
      "\n",
      "  “If the arteries of credit now clogged well-nigh to choking by the\n",
      "  obstructions created through the control of these groups are opened\n",
      "  so that they may be permitted freely to play their important part\n",
      "  in the financial system, competition in large enterprises will\n",
      "  become possible and business can be conducted on its merits instead\n",
      "  of being subject to the tribute and the good will of this handful\n",
      "  of self-constituted trustees of the national prosperity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The promise of New Freedom was joyously proclaimed in 1913.. The key to their power is Combination--concentration\n",
      "intensive and comprehensive--advancing on three distinct lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "_First:_ There is the obvious consolidation of banks and trust\n",
      "companies; the less obvious affiliations--through stockholdings, voting\n",
      "trusts and interlocking directorates--of banking institutions which\n",
      "are not legally connected; and the joint transactions, gentlemen’s\n",
      "agreements, and “banking ethics” which eliminate competition among the\n",
      "investment bankers.. *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "The development of our financial oligarchy followed, in this respect,\n",
      "lines with which the history of political despotism has familiarized\n",
      "us:--usurpation, proceeding by gradual encroachment rather than by\n",
      "violent acts; subtle and often long-concealed concentration of distinct\n",
      "functions, which are beneficent when separately administered, and\n",
      "dangerous only when combined in the same persons.. This dependence, both of corporations and of\n",
      "investors, upon the banker has grown in recent years, since women and\n",
      "others who do not participate in the management, have become the owners\n",
      "of so large a part of the stocks and bonds of our great corporations.. Over half of the stockholders of the American Sugar Refining Company\n",
      "and nearly half of the stockholders of the Pennsylvania Railroad and of\n",
      "the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad are women.. With the advent of Big Business such good-will possessed\n",
      "by the older banking houses, preëminently J. P. Morgan & Co. and their\n",
      "Philadelphia House called Drexel & Co., by Lee, Higginson & Co. and\n",
      "Kidder, Peabody, & Co. of Boston, and by Kuhn, Loeb & Co. of New York,\n",
      "became of enhanced importance.. It was\n",
      "in this way that the Morgan associates acquired their hold upon the\n",
      "Southern Railway, the Northern Pacific, the Reading, the Erie, the Père\n",
      "Marquette, the Chicago and Great Western, and the Cincinnati, Hamilton\n",
      "& Dayton.. The investment banker, through his controlling influence\n",
      "on the Board of Directors, decides that the corporation shall issue\n",
      "and sell the securities, decides the price at which it shall sell\n",
      "them, and decides that it shall sell the securities to himself.. Within five years all of these\n",
      "stocks, so far as distributed by the insurance companies, have found\n",
      "their way into the hands of the men who virtually controlled or were\n",
      "identified with the management of the insurance companies or of their\n",
      "close allies and associates, to that extent thus further entrenching\n",
      "them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The banks and trust companies are depositaries, in the main, not of the\n",
      "people’s savings, but of the business man’s quick capital.. As the Pujo Committee finds:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The men who through their control over the funds of our railroads and\n",
      "industrial companies are able to direct where such funds shall be kept\n",
      "and thus to create these great reservoirs of the people’s money, are\n",
      "the ones who are in position to tap those reservoirs for the ventures\n",
      "in which they are interested and to prevent their being tapped for\n",

      "\n",
      "The so-called fees and commissions taken by the bankers and associates\n",

      "directors of their controlled trust companies and of the First National\n",
      "and the National City Bank together hold:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "_First:_ There are 56 other corporations (not included in the Pujo\n",

      "aggregating nearly $1,350,000,000, in which the Morgan allies are\n",
      "represented according to the directories of directors.. Then J. P. Morgan & Co., the National\n",
      "City, and the First National (or their dominant officers--Mr. Stillman\n",
      "and Mr. Baker) acquired together, by stock purchases and voting trusts,\n",
      "control of the National Bank of Commerce, with its $190,000,000 of\n",
      "resources; of the Chase National, with $125,000,000; of the Guaranty\n",
      "Trust Company, with $232,000,000; of the Bankers’ Trust Company, with\n",
      "$205,000,000; and of a number of smaller, but important, financial\n",

      "systems; and finally (as if the allies were united into a single\n",
      "concern) loyal and efficient service in the banks--like that rendered\n",
      "by Mr. Davison and Mr. Lamont in the First National--was rewarded by\n",
      "promotion to membership in the firm of J. P. Morgan & Co.. Around Boston proper are over thirty suburbs, which with\n",
      "it form what is popularly known as “Greater Boston.” These suburban\n",
      "municipalities, and also other important cities like Worcester and\n",
      "Springfield, are, in many respects, within Boston’s “sphere of\n",
      "influence.” Boston’s inner banking group has interlocked, not only 33\n",
      "of the 42 banks of Boston proper, as above shown, but has linked with\n",
      "them, by interlocking directorships, at least 42 other banks and trust\n",
      "companies in 35 other municipalities.. “Radiating from these principal groups,” says the Pujo Committee, “and\n",
      "closely affiliated with them are smaller but important banking houses,\n",
      "such as Kissel, Kinnicut & Co., White, Weld & Co., and Harvey Fisk &\n",

      "securities, the issuing of which they control, but which for reasons\n",
      "of their own they prefer not to have issued or distributed under their\n",
      "own names.. When the New Haven concluded to market\n",
      "$17,200,000 of these bonds, J. P. Morgan & Co., “for reasons of their\n",

      "their own name.” The Morgan firm took the bonds at 92 1/2 net; and the\n",
      "bonds were marketed by Kissel, Kinnicut & Co. and others at 96 1/4.. It was\n",
      "  impossible to learn the identity of these corporations, owing to\n",
      "  the unwillingness of the members of the inner group to disclose\n",
      "  the names of their underwriters, but sufficient appears to justify\n",
      "  the statement that there are at least hundreds of them and that\n",
      "  they extend into many of the cities throughout this and foreign\n",
      "  countries.. Such patronage yields no inconsiderable part of the income of\n",
